# Contributing to OCamlPro Open-Source Software

As most open-source projects, we need to keep a record of the intellectual
property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity.
OCamlPro SAS ("OCamlPro")
must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been
signed (electronically) by each Contributor, indicating agreement to
the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a
Contributor as well as the protection of OCamlPro and its users; it
does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any
other purpose.

* [Individual CLA](http://www.ocamlpro.com/files/CLA-OCamlPro-individual.txt): 
  if your contribution to our software does not belong to your employer, you
  should fill the form in this page within an email and send it to us.
* [Corporate CLA](http://www.ocamlpro.com/files/CLA-OCamlPro-corporate.txt):
  if your contribution belongs to your employer, we need your employer to
  authorize us to use the work you submit to us (it can also be used for
  other employees at the same time). You should print it, make your boss sign
  it and send us a scanned copy.

CLAs should be sent to contact@ocamlpro.com.
